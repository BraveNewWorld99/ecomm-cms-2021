Logging in, loggin out, and actions where no username is set have been accounted for using the
following code snippet.  $action is the variable that defines what is happening. $username is a variable
that is set if the user has logged in.

$action != "login" && $action != "logout" && !$username

We need to account for the following actions and add these to the code snippet above.
The answer will be one single line of code.

1.  We are resetting the password
2.  We are updating the password

These are the conditions that are true:
A. We are not logging in as the action
B. We are not logging out as the action
C. No username has been set

Solve where A. B. and C. are true and also 1. OR 2. are not true

Answer:

$action != "resetPassword" && $action != "updatePassword" && $action != "login" && $action != "logout" && !$username 

NOT 1.
AND
NOT 2.
AND
NOT A.
AND 
NOT B.
AND
NOT C.
